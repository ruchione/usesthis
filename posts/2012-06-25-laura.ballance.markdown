#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I am Laura Ballance. I run a record label called [Merge Records](http://www.mergerecords.com/ "Merge Record's website.") and play bass in a band called [Superchunk](http://www.superchunk.com/ "Superchunk's website."). I also dabble in the [visual arts](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ballance_suers/sets/72157630105375970/ "Photos of Laura's artwork on Flickr.") and cooking and [preserving food](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ballance_suers/5278490460/in/set-72157623186254097 "A photo of a ham.").

#### What hardware do you use?

For Merge I do most of my work on a Dell desktop computer with two screens. One is 18" and the other is 24". I do a fair amount of work on spreadsheets where I have to look at [Quickbooks][] and [Excel][] at the same time so I need both screens going. I use a totally mundane mouse that I have set up to work left-handed, because I am one of those.
At home and when I travel I use a Toshiba mini netbook. It weighs about 3 pounds and is great for email. Sometimes it gets a little slow when I try to watch video on it, but that's probably my fault for letting it get clogged up.

I also have an [HTC Sensation][sensation] smart phone. I try not to be on it too much though. I do not appreciate how connected everyone feels like they have to be these days.

To rock I use a ['79 Fender Precision Bass][precision-bass], a 2x15" [Ampeg cabinet][b25b] and an [Acoustic 370 head][370]. This head is insanely loud and I never turn it past 2 or it would seriously damage the area. The cabinet is really old, probably from the 1970's and looks terrible. It has taken a serious beating from 20 odd years of touring, but it's really well built. The joints are [dovetail joints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dovetail_joint "The Wikipedia entry for dovetail joints.") and they have really held up. It used to have Altec speakers in there that were probably original, but after re-coning them about 8 times I bought some Electro-Voice speakers and put them in there. They rule. If I have to fly I use a rented 2x15 Ampeg if I can get it and an [Orange Terror Bass][bass-terror-1000] head. This thing is light (weighs about 5% of what the Acoustic head weighs) and sounds great. I use a [Boss TU-2 Chromatic pedal tuner][tu-2]. My secret weapon is a custom [Crowther Audio Hotcake][the-hotcake]. I got one after touring with the 3d's (it was 1994 maybe) and hearing their bass player Denise use one. It is distorted without being too high endy.

For drawing I just got some [Palomino Blackwing][blackwing] and [Blackwing 602][blackwing-602] pencils. They feel awesome.

For working with [clay](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ballance_suers/7177283435/ "A photo of one of Laura's clay artworks.") I got some retired dental tools from my dentist and a cheap rolling pin from the Asian market. I love that she was willing to give me those tools instead of throwing them in the trash. I had to promise I would not use them on my teeth.

For taking photos I have been using a [Panasonic DMC-FX01][lumix-dmc-fx01] for ages. At this point, my phone has resolution just as high but it's not as good in low light. For the last year or so I have been experimenting with the Lomo [Diana F+][diana-f-plus]. It uses 120 film, and it turns out I am [kind of a disaster](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ballance_suers/6951191372/ "A film photo by Laura.") with remembering I can't let light in or else. I have a wide angle and and a fish-eye lens which I really enjoy.

#### And what software?

Mostly I write emails all day and do some accounting related projects. I use multi-user Quickbooks Enterprise Solutions 10, Excel, and [Firefox][]. I use the [Gmail][] web interface for all my email. It's the best. I love it. Most of the time.
I [tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/scarpatty "Laura's Twitter account."), but I am not a dedicated tweeter. 

#### What would be your dream setup?

Oh boy. Well, with the computer stuff I think I am satisfied. In my dreams I would spend my days making things with my hands and would never have to use a computer again, but that's not going to happen. 

I wish I could have the bass I have now, but that it would somehow magically weigh about 5 pounds less than it does. Maybe some wood bees could handle that for me. Oh, and I wish the Acoustic 370 and my personal, improved Ampeg cabinet could also experience some weight loss and conveniently shrink to pocket size for air travel.

I have an old [LC-A][] camera and wish there were other lenses I could put on it. Also, I wish I had a flash for it. I think it would be a good idea for me to use 35mm film so that I am not waving film around in the air and making an exposure mess.
