#### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hello world! I'm Susan Lin, ['bysusanlin'](http://bysusanlin.com/ "Susan's website.") online. I work in a myriad of mediums including design, code, pen, pixel art, and paint. Professionally, I currently work at [Treehouse][] as a designer and spend my after hours as [an artist](http://shop.bysusanlin.com/ "Susan's online store."). You may have seen my [sketchnotes](http://sketch.bysusanlin.com/tagged/sketchnotes "Susan's sketchnotes.") or one of my [watercolor trees](http://levelframes.com/collections/watercolor-trees "Susan's watercolour trees.").

#### What hardware do you use?

*Let's start with machines*. I prefer the [13" MacBook Pro Retina][macbook-pro]. Its specs are: 3.1GHz i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Things are backed-up on a [Seagate 4TB USB 3.0 External HD][backup-plus]. I wield 2 [Thunderbolt monitors][thunderbolt-display]. It spoils me to say, but I don't remember how I worked without the second one before â€“ it's indispensable for coding, exporting UI assets, and updating my prints shop. One of the monitors sits on a [Grovemade Maple Stand][maple-monitor-stand].

I've previously busted my right arm to overwork and bad posture. I use the [Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard][sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard] and [Evoluent Vertical Mouse][verticalmouse-small-wireless] while resting on a Memory Foam Mousepad and a Memory Foam elbow rest. Super ugly, but very functional. The [Magic Trackpack][magic-trackpad] helps keep things symmetrical. I recently upgraded to a [GeekDesk][] at home. I sit in a [Mirra 2 Chair][mirra], in Dark Turquoise of course.

Miscellaneous tools on my desk are organized by MUJI acrylic pen holders and stands. I own a [Wacom Intuos tablet][intuos] and [Yiynova tablet][msp19u-plus] (the poor man's Cintiq). I use them way less than I should. Somewhere on the desk, there's [a wireless Xbox controller][xbox-360-controller-for-windows] and receiver. I used to make games in college, but now I usually just play them. I takeover the dining table [(an IKEA picnic table where I take most of my instagram shots)](https://instagram.com/p/64Fwfky4_T/ "Susan's photo of her table on Instagram.") and sit in an [Aqua Sky Shell Eames Chair][eames-molded-plastic-chairs] when I want to change it up.

*Speaking of Ergonomic*... 3M's Futuro Wrist Supports are the best. I have a foam roller for back pain therapy. Lying on it for 5 minutes a day helps reverse the damage you're doing working at your desk. I have [a custom molded elbow brace made of thermoplastic](https://instagram.com/p/55jEUwS41K/ "Susan's photo of her elbow brace on Instagram."). Ergonomic equipment is very ugly. I've thought about starting a company that makes stylish ergonomic equipment more than once. Last, but not least, I stick a Salonpas patch anywhere it hurts to power through the day.

*Moving on to art*. For painting, I choose quality and portability above all. My current set-up is a 24 half-pan Schmincke palette paired with da Vinci Maestro travel brushes at sizes 2, 3 and 5. Schmincke is very expensive, so if you're reading this and thinking about starting watercolor: a great entry level choice would be Kuretake Gansai Tambi. My preferred inking pens are [Staedtlers][pigment-liner-308]. I just picked up an ink and nib set. Choices were the [Tachikawa Comic Pen Nib][comic-pen-nib-holder-model-40] and extra dark waterproof Deleter ink to try out. The only eraser I trust are the [Pentel Hi-Polymer erasers][hi-polymer-eraser]. I've been using the same [Staedtler Mars Drafting Pencil 0.7mm][mars-draft-0.7mm] since freshmen year of college. For sketchnoting, MUJI giant F4 sketchbooks are key. Notes are scribbled with a [Uniball Jetstream 3 Color Pen][jetstream-3-0.7mm] and shaded with various colors of Kuretake Zig Clean Color watercolor calligraphy pens.] To get the painted effect, I run the Kuretake Zig watercolor brush to dissolve the calligraphy pen's ink.

*Some other things I use*. I take photos with a [Panasonic DMC-GF7KK][lumix-dmc-gf7kk]. A [Slik tripod][sprint-pro-ii] has been the most useful purchase I've made lately. I also bought a mount that holds phones. I'll have the [iPhone 5S][iphone-5s] for about a month more. I'm very happy with my [Braun BN0031][bn0031] for telling time. It's the perfect color and [matches my favorite teapot and mug](https://twitter.com/bysusanlin/status/634112529678012417 "Susan's tweet about her teapot and mug.").

#### And what software?

For email, I stubbornly hang onto [Sparrow for Mac][sparrow] and use [Mailbox on iPhone][mailbox].

Like most in my profession, I use [Adobe Creative Suite][creative-suite]. In the epic battle between [Sketch][] vs [Photoshop][], I'll use what my team prefers so we can share files easily. Meaning, someone else usually has a strong opinion. [Illustrator][] is prime for SVG graphics and [SVGO][] is prime for trimming the output. In addition to photo editing, there's a great way to [set-up Photoshop to do pixel art](http://www.brandontreb.com/configuring-photoshop-for-pixel-art/ "An article for doing pixel art in Photoshop.").

For coding, I use [Atom][] and [iTerm2][]. For making and presenting talks, I use [Keynote][].

Software I leave running include [Caffeine][] (disables sleep on computer), [1Password][] (you won't regret using a password manager), [f.lux][] (helps me remember to go to bed on time), [Screenhero][] (best screensharing software I know of), and [Dropbox][] (file storage and syncing).

[nvALT on Desktop][nvalt] and [Simplenote on iPhone][simplenote-ios] are indispensable to me. I enjoy the plain text aspect of the product... anything more complex would distract from writing what I want written down. Most of my projects (code, design, and art) start as massive plain text braindumps. 

I prefer [Alfred 2][alfred] over the native Spotlight search. Extensions such as [Color Converter][color-converter] and [Emoji Workflow][emoji-workflow] are amazing. 

I have a thing for customizability. I built [an RSS page](http://daily.bysusanlin.com/ "Susan's RSS page.") after the decease of [Google Reader][google-reader] (RIP). Extensions I use for the browser include [AdBlock][] (I will pay to support your product when prompted, because sorry I don't want to meet hot singles in my area unless they are [_these_ hot singles](http://adultcatfinder.com/ "A site for finding attractive cats in your local area.").) I have the [Pin it button][pin-it]. I am a packrat on the web, I [hoard inspiration and references](https://www.pinterest.com/susanl/pins/ "Susan's Pinterest account.") like a madwoman. [Smooth Gestures][smooth-gestures] helps keep things moving fast. [User Styles](https://userstyles.org/ "A collection of user stylesheets.") because I [overwrite interfaces](http://metalbat.com/carefree.css.txt "A user style for tweaking Twitter's website.") I find noisy, but still find value in otherwise. And finally, [Type-ahead-find][] searches for links as you type. I'm surprised this isn't native!

I'm crazy about these [Ghibli Mac Icons](http://dlanham.com/ui/ghibli/ "David's Ghibli icons."). It makes interacting with my software a delight.

#### What would be your dream setup?

I've iterated a lot on my tools and am very pleased with the choices themselves. The next level setup would be to find a space that I can manipulate. For once I'd like to be able to drill holes into the walls without worry! My ultimate dream is to live in a [MUJI home](http://www.muji.net/ie/tatenoie/ "A narrow little house."), I need to space for one of their [bead cushions.](http://www.muji.com/jp/beadssofa/ "A beanbag.") Ideally, I will have a dog companion in the near future.
