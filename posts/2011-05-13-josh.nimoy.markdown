#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Josh Nimoy](http://jtnimoy.net "Josh's website."), an artist, designer, hacktivist, [musician](http://thenimoys.com "The Nimoys' website."), and software developer. I've done a lot of generative visuals for film and television, and my personal work has shown in legitimate galleries and museums. My open source contributions have been [JMyron][myron], a computer vision library, and various addons for the software art community.

#### What hardware do you use?

I'm using a [13" Macbook Pro][macbook-pro] with 2.66 GHz Intel Core Duo, and the graphics card is an NVIDIA GeForce 320M. I carry a [Motorola Droid 2][droid-2]. I sport a [Radioshack 22-802 Auto-Ranging multimeter][22-802], a [Weller WES51][wes51] analog soldering station, and a [Leatherman Squirt E4][squirt-e4]. I program firmware with a [Xeltek SuperPro 280U][superpro-280u]. I prefer [shift registers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_register "The Wikipedia entry for shift registers.") over [demultiplexers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexer "The Wikipedia entry for multiplexers"). I solder lead-free. I choose [RoHS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_of_Hazardous_Substances_Directive "The Wikipedia entry for RoHS.").

#### And what software?

The Mac runs [OS X Snow Leopard][mac-os-x] (with [MacPorts][]) and [Windows XP SP2][windows-xp] (with [Cygwin][]). When compiling on the Mac, I use a [Makefile][make] with [gcc][] and sometimes [scons][]. I use [emacs][] as my IDE, splitting the editor in half and having [eshell][] in the top window to run the Makefile. I will also compile in [Xcode][], [Code::Blocks][codeblocks], and [Visual Studio][visual-studio] depending on the project.

For version control, I use [git][] and [svn][subversion]. For general shell scripting, I choose [Python][]. For server-side scripting, I choose [PHP][]. I do [software art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_art "The Wikipedia entry for Software Art.") using boilerplates like [jttoolkit][], [OpenFrameworks][], [Processing][], and [Cinder][]. In [C++][c-plusplus], I prefer the GUI toolkit [wxWidgets][].

#### What would be your dream setup?

Keyboards are okay, but I'd rather have [electrodes](http://www.desicolours.com/tech/a-new-software-allows-typing-with-brain-waves/09/12/2009 "An article on electrodes in the brain allowing for typing.") built into me. I'd like a high resolution [virtual retinal display](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_retinal_display "The Wikipedia entry on virtual retinal displays.") embedded inside my head so I can be using a computer and it would just look to everyone else like I'm sitting and doing nothing. I'd love to see my team members use Linux, and to see my production companies supporting open source, but they are designers and art directors with old philosophies about intellectual property, and they probably see me like [xkcd Infrastructures](http://xkcd.com/743/ "The 'Infrastructures' xkcd comic."). I also want more cell towers between Los Angeles and San Francisco.
