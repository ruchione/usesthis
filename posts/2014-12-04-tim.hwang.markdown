#### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi! I'm [Tim Hwang](http://timhwang.org/ "Tim's website."). Currently, I'm Director of Marketing at [Imgur][]. Over the past five years, the site has become a key piece of infrastructure for web culture, and I work to help build a range of partnerships and experimental projects around that.

In addition to the day job, I'm also involved in an ever-evolving blend of side projects: I'm the co-founder of something called the [Awesome Foundation for the Arts and Sciences](http://www.awesomefoundation.org/ "The Awesome Foundation."), just finished with a conference called [TableFlip](http://tableflip.us/ "A tabletop gaming conference."), am a fellow at a research center called [Data & Society](http://www.datasociety.net/ "A research think tank in New York.") in New York, working on a book about [shipping containers](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timhwang/the-container-guide "Tim's Kickstarted shipping containers field guide."), and just got back from a trip to visit all the [world's largest balls of twine](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/twisted-the-battle-to-be-the-worlds-largest-ball-of-twine/379828/ "An Atlantic article about the world's largest ball of twin."). 

#### What hardware do you use?

"Old-fashioned" isn't the right word: but I have a pretty humble hardware stack since I tend to run tech into the ground before getting new stuff. My main computer is a [13" MacBook Pro circa 2011][macbook-pro], which gets connected to all the necessary peripherals at the home and office. At the office, that is a dual monitor set up, with the laptop mounted on an adjustable [Ergotron standing desk][workfit-s]. At home, that's a Samsung monitor sitting on a stack of old books. 

In the land of mobile, I'm still rocking an early generation [iPhone 4, which chugs along with 3G data][iphone-4]. Continual upgrades have rendered the thing flaky but still vaguely reliable. For calls and music, I have a pair of [Yamaha EPH-100s][eph-100]. I'm also usually packing my old model [Kindle Touch][kindle-touch].

To be honest, my primary bits of hardware remain analog, despite my projects getting deep into technology: I have a "control room" whiteboard hanging in my room that tracks the status of all projects I'm currently involved in with dry-erase marker (Expos for life), and still design schemes with a run-of-the-mill notebook and a small Muji A6. I'm particular about pens though - I'm always carrying a [Pentel Energel NV][energel-nv], a habit I picked up at law school that has been with me since. 

#### And what software?

Software mirrors hardware. Most of my projects involve alchemically transmuting stacks of e-mails into reality, so [Gmail][], [iCal][], and [gDocs][google-docs] are things that I live by. There are many to-do and personal organizer apps out there - but the muss and feature bloat of all those make them more trouble than they're worth, in my opinion. Day to day workflow and task organization gets tracked with a combination of calendar notes and an elaborate system of text files (always will have a soft spot in my heart for [Notepad.exe][notepad]). I'm inside [iWork][] most of the rest of the time. Apps on the phone are pretty typical, though I've particularly enjoyed [Somebody][somebody-ios] and [Spaceteam][spaceteam-ios], as of late.

Outside of that, I tend to keep the social feeds open. [Tweetbot][] is my go-to client for [Twitter][], and I usually have a tab open with [Facebook][]. [gChat][google-talk] is always on invisible, though. [Hipchat][] is our team platform for Imgur, so I'm usually slinging emoji around there on the channels.

#### What would be your dream setup?

By and large, most setups are productivity theater. Ever-escalating complexity and rafts of features generally distract from the basic tasks that need to be done. Simpler is better: my dream set up is a quiet room with a nice view and a powerful computer running the most lightweight applications that money can buy. 

Though, [having one of these](http://www.cantstopthemovies.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/The-War-Room.jpg "A picture of the war room in Dr Strangelove.") to work in wouldn't be half bad, either.
