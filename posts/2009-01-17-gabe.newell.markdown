#### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Gabe Newell. I'm the co-founder and president of [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/ "They made a little game called 'Half Life'.'"), a videogame developer.

#### What hardware do you use?

I have an overclocked quad-core Intel CPU, SLI NVIDIA graphics cards, an ancient Microsoft ergonomic keyboard I refuse to give up, and a [Razer gaming mouse](http://www2.razerzone.com/MouseGuide/index.html "Razer make gaming peripherals.") on a Valve mouse pad. My desk is an all aluminum [Lian-Li][oa-f1], and I have a Panasonic 42" HD TV as my monitor. I have an over the air HD receiver, and use Snapstream's [BeyondTV][beyond-tv] as a PVR.

#### And what software?

I've downgraded to [Windows XP][windows-xp] and [Office 2003][office]. I've tried [Chrome][], and gone back to [Firefox][]. In addition to [MS DevStudio][visual-studio], we use [Perforce][] and [IncrediBuild][]. For RSS, I use [Bloglines.com][bloglines]. And we have a bunch of tools we have created ourselves.

#### What would be your dream setup?

The main thing is to have a process more than a single particular setup. I've tried all sorts of home-built systems, including water cooled, phase change, etc... The conclusion I've reached is that upgrading every 6 months is more important than trying to get the fastest possible system at one point of time. The time and energy I used to spend optimizing my hardware I now spend making sure it's easy to swap out my current machine for a new machine with the least downtime.
