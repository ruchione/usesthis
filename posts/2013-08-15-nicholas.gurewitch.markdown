#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I make the comic strips at [pbfcomics.com](http://pbfcomics.com/ "The Perry Bible Fellowship comics.").

#### What hardware do you use?

I use a wide range of art supplies to create the comics. It's different for each strip, but my colors usually come from Prismacolor markers, colored pencils, inks, oil pastels, guache, watercolors, and acrylics. I often mix them. It can get pretty alchemic sometimes. Sometimes I'll dip a marker in ink before using it to smear chalk around. Using markers to smear chalk was something I got into on ["Roxanne"](http://www.pbfcomics.com/254/ "The 'Roxanne' PBF comic.") and ["Different"](http://www.pbfcomics.com/255/ "The 'Different' PBF comic.").

#### And what software?

I do a lot of post-production work on the computer as well. Lately it's been limited to color adjustment on [Adobe Photoshop][photoshop]. I'm fond of limiting the color-range of certain elements. For example, on a recent PBF, ["Honk"](http://pbfcomics.com/258/ "The 'Honk' PBF comic."), I sucked the yellows out of everything except the clowns and the clown car by tracing them with the polygonal Lasso tool, inverting the selection, and then adjusting color-balance.

#### What would be your dream setup?

My dream set up would probably be a Disney-esque studio in the 1930's with a team of cheery colorists and painters that all hung out together on lunch and dinner breaks. This would be a well-ventilated non-Hollywood studio located in a field or forest. I also dream of having an environmentally friendly studio that has zero carbon footprint and never disposes of anything (including cells, backgrounds, and sets). Shreds of old works would be reintegrated into new works in such a way that people employed at that studio felt part of an ageless dynasty of creation that could be traced through eternity.
