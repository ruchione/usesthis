#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm a songwriter-producer in four bands: [The Magnetic Fields](http://www.houseoftomorrow.com/magneticfields/ "Stephin's band."), a sort of variety-show format; [The 6ths](http://www.houseoftomorrow.com/6ths/ "Stephin's band."), in which celebrity singers sing my songs; [Future Bible Heroes](http://www.houseoftomorrow.com/new-page-1/ "Stephin's band."), a fusion of electropop with genre literature; and [The Gothic Archies](http://www.houseoftomorrow.com/gothicarchies/ "Stephin's band."), bubblegum for those who wear black. I've also written four musicals, most recently the Neil Gaiman adaptation Coraline. And a few soundtracks. My most recent release is a book of verse called [*101 Two-Letter Words*](http://www.amazon.com/101-Two-Letter-Words-Stephin-Merritt/dp/0393240193 "Stephin's book of verse.").

#### What hardware do you use?

Since there are things you can do on old computers that you can't do on new ones, I run [Pro Tools][pro-tools] from 2006, on a [Mac Pro][mac-pro] from 2006. When a new computer can vary the speed in real time without degrading the signal, I'll upgrade. Till then, I'll stick with my clunky tank.

#### And what software?

Aside from the Mac Pro, I have a studio full of vintage synthesizers and rhythm units, many from Roland (I have been reading I Believe in Music, the charming memoir by Roland founder Ikutaro Kakehashi); and more recent esoteric and fascinating devices from Dewanatron, Ekdahl, Snazzy FX, Moog, etc. and many other instruments, including a collection of ukuleles. No two instruments sound the same.

#### What would be your dream setup?

I live in a townhouse with a similar house on either side. If I could buy one (or both!) of the houses next door, I could double the size of my studio just by knocking down a wall. Then I'd have room for a harpsichord! A reverb chamber! A drum room! A gamelan orchestra! Prepared piano(s)! A toy train set that plays percussion as it goes by, forming a very large and slow electroacoustic rhythm unit! These are the things I think about when I have too much caffeine.
