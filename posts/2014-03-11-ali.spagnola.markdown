#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Ali Spagnola](http://www.alispagnola.com/ "Ali's website"). I make nice things. I write [music](http://www.alispagnola.com/music/ "Ali's music.") and perform live [drinking game concerts](http://www.powerhouralbum.com/ "Ali's drinking game."). My most recent album comes on a [Shot Glass USB](http://www.alispagnola.com/powerhour/store/shot-glass-usb/ "Ali's shot glass USB drive containing her album.") that I invented. I [defeated a trademark troll](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ali-s-power-hour-freedom-victory-tour "Ali's Indiegogo campaign.") and [toured the nation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05EfRP2n3oI "A video of Ali on tour.") to celebrate. I create one [Free Painting](http://www.alispagnola.com/Free/ "Ali's free paintings service.") a day and mail it to the person that requested it. I'm also an [artist/designer](http://www.portfolio.alispagnola.com/ "Ali's portfolio.").

#### What hardware do you use?

My laptop is a 2013 15" [Macbook Pro][macbook-pro] Retina. My electric piano is a [Yamaha S08][s08]. It's got weighted keys and all 88 of them, of course. My electric guitar is an [American Fender Stratocaster][stratocaster]. His name is Jack and he's blue. Though, I photoshopped him red for my album box. All my paintings are acrylic on 12"x12" canvas board. One square foot of art a day! My acoustic guitar is a [C.F. Martin & Co. GPCPA4][gpcpa4] with a Rosewood body. I just recently got him so I haven't decided if his name should be Martin or something having to do with Rosewood.

I have two Roland keytars. One is an [AX-Synth][] and the other is a [Lucina AX-09][lucina-ax-09]. My audio interface is an [Apogee Quartet][quartet]. I play a set of [Roland TD-6 electric drums][td-6]. My in-ear monitors for live performances are a set of [Ultimate Ears 4][ultimate-ears-pro] that were custom shaped by an audiologist that squirted blue goo into my brain though my ears. My camera is a [Canon T3i][eos-rebel-t3i]. I record vocals with an [Audio Technica AT2020 mic][at2020]. I record acoustic guitar with an Audio Technica AT2012 mic. I broadcast my livestream show with a [Blue Snowball mic][snowball]. My toothbrush is a [Sonicare Essence][sonicare-essence].

#### And what software?

[Evernote][]. Everything I ever thought or will think is in Evernote. I love Evernote so much I wish I could grind it up and snort it.

I write/record all my music in [Logic X][logic-pro]. My favorite visual program is [Photoshop][]. I do my video editing in [Premiere][] and my motion graphics in [After Effects][after-effects]. Last year I switched my browser to [Chrome][] because it seemed that my smart friends use it. I still also use [Safari][] for a separate [Gmail][] account and keep it in a separate "Space". I also love Mac's Expos√© & Spaces and just recently bought a [Magic Mouse][magic-mouse] to take full advantage of it. Sorry, that should be under the hardware question. 

#### What would be your dream setup?

A recording studio that's also a dance studio. I'm not really particular with the hardware or software. I just want an awesome studio that's connected to a room with hardwood floors and wall to wall mirrors so I can choreograph and compose simultaneously. I would love a grand piano in that room, too. For both posing on and playing.
