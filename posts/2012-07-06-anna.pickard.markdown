#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Anna Pickard, I do words. Mainly typed words. I have typed words for newspapers like [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/ "The Guardian's website.") and games like [Glitch][glitch.2], as well as giving voice to megalomaniacal polydactyl cats and butter gods for the social media arms of [advertising campaigns](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=193357410698478&set=a.190463237654562.45746.186933131340906&type=3&theater "Bertrum Thumbcat on a goat. Really.") and any other kind of writing anyone wants me to do. I have also for the last ten years or more typed words for [My Blog](http://www.littleredboat.co.uk "Anna's website."), though I admit I haven't written nearly enough of those since giving birth to a tiny human at the beginning of this year. 

#### What hardware do you use?

My one and only pooter is a 13" [Macbook Pro][macbook-pro], which I've had for about two years, a bit of a record for my recent run of laptops. I love them hard. This one has had the hard drive swapped out after it mysteriously died, the lid replaced thanks to a defective camera, and several keys swapped out after they got [chocolate brownie batter](http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2007/mar/07/foodanddrink.recipe1 "A recipe for chocolate brownies.") under them while cooking, and still it lives on, the frankenstein's monster of MacBooks. I think it knows that I've been secretly wishing death on it so I can get my longed-for [Macbook Air][macbook-air], and is therefore stubbornly refusing to die just to spite me.

My [iPhone 4][iphone-4] has been indispensable particularly since having a baby, a beautiful inconvenience that tends to pin you in chairs and on sofas with your computer just out of reach. There's also an [iPad][ipad-2] which has proved marginally useful, as it tends to slide off things. And a [Kindle][] which is currently a very neat little repository for books that I intend to read but probably never will. Oh, and a [Nike Fuelband][fuelband], which is making me feel comforted about not having time for exercise, as apparently looking after a small baby racks up the fuel points (although I may be cheating by wearing it on my rattle-shaking hand...)

#### And what software?

A very boring standard set of basics: [Gmail][] for email and videochats with family and friends, [Skype][] for work phonecalls, [Adium][] for IM, IRC, etc. 

For writing, I've discovered I tend to fit the programme to the type of writing I'm doing. For some types of copy I'll use [Word][], for stuff that I need to lose my head in completely, [Writeroom][]; for things that I want to get done quickly and with a conversational tone I'll open a draft blog post in [Wordpress][], as that gets my brain in the mood; and for large or complicated projects with lots of research materials, [Scrivener][].

[Visual Thesaurus][visual-thesaurus], while having an occasionally annoying UI, can really help to send my brain on useful little tangents.

Using [Freedom][], cutting off all Internet connectivity for a specified amount of time. Which stops me from wasting hours upon end obsessively watching things like tourists crossing the road at [Abbey Road](http://www.abbeyroad.com/crossing "The infamous crossing on Abbey Road.") (more addictive than it sounds).

And [Twitter][]. An inveterate (and veteran) twitterer, I try to curb my easy-distractibility by keeping my following list to a strict one-in-one-out list of 99 people that I actually know. It seems rude to some, but is the only way that I can keep myself from clicking on the constantly updating Twitter(+N) tab. I am also a grudging Facebook citizen, but only because I found I was missing out on parties entirely arranged on the facebook.

In terms of apps, the usual maps, tweetdecks and games that everyone mentions - but also (utterly indispensable for the last six months) [iBaby Feed][ibaby-feed-timer-ios] for timing the duration and intervals between breastfeeding, [Baby Log][baby-log-ios] to record and display precisely when and for how long my baby naps (raw data is good, charts are even better), and [White Noise Ambience][white-noise-ambience-ios], an app that will play the noise of a tumble dryer to my child when he refuses to sleep, so that I don't have to bother installing a tumble dryer next to his crib.

#### What would be your dream setup?

A lighter laptop to carry around the house one-handed with a baby on the other arm. Basically I'm lusting after a Macbook Air.
