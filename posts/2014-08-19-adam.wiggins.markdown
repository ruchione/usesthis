#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Adam Wiggins](http://about.adamwiggins.com/ "Adam's website."), hacker and tech entrepreneur. I make companies (such as [Heroku][]) and I write (such as [The Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/ "Adam's site about the twelve-factor development methodology.") and [End-user computing](https://medium.com/the-truant-haruspex/end-user-computing-5367171478b7 "Adam's article about end-user computing.")). My hobbies include making [music](https://soundcloud.com/hirodusk "Adam's music on SoundCloud.") and [video games][tetryon-ios], and my social cause these days is [ending marijuana prohibition](http://mpp.org/ "A project for removing prohibition of marijuana.")

#### What hardware do you use?

Pretty standard setup: a 13" [Macbook Pro][macbook-pro]. I spend almost all my time in [iTerm 2][iterm2] and [Chrome][]. I'm not interested in most of the productivity software that comes bundled with the OS: I see the Macbook as a great piece of integrated hardware that lets me run a browser and terminal.

I keep the Dock hidden and launch applications exclusively with [Alfred][]. And I use a lot of custom launchers as scriptable bookmarks.

After six years as a die-hard iPhone user, I switched to an [unlocked HTC One][one-m8] last year, and I so far I've stuck with it. I always carry a SIM card switcher since I use different SIM cards when traveling internationally. And a MyCharge aux battery, because running out of battery while on the go is no fun.

[Audio-Technica QuietPoint noise-canceling headphones][ath-anc7b] plus generated white noise via [A Soft Murmur](http://asoftmurmur.com/?v=1e502800000000000000 "Adam's white noise mix on A Soft Murmur.") block out distraction while working.

I carry a notebook with gridlined paper and a pen, because scribbling on a page helps me think.

#### And what software?

For writing, my workflow bounces between several tools. It starts with a draft in [TextMate][] written in [Markdown][]. Then I paste the formatted output into [Google Docs][google-docs] in order to collaborate with co-authors or copyeditors. Then when it's time to publish, it's another cut-and-paste job into [Medium](https://medium.com/@hirodusk "Adam's Medium account."). For some things I find it more appropriate to publish to [Gist](https://gist.github.com/adamwiggins "Adam's Gists."), like [my Heroku values document](https://gist.github.com/adamwiggins/5687294 "Adam's values document for Heroku."). (I hope [Draft][] or [others](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/04/17/after-editorially-alternative-collaborative-online-writing-tools/ "An article about online collaborative editors.") might one day unify this workflow.)

For web development, my go-to stack for many years has been [Vim][], [Git][], [Ruby][], [Bundler][], [Sinatra][], [Postgres][postgresql], [Sequel][], [GitHub][], Heroku, and [S3][].

For visual authoring, I get a lot of milage out of open-source tools. For example, [this album cover](https://soundcloud.com/hirodusk/antikythera-mechanism-disc-1 "One of Adam's albums on SoundCloud.") made using [the Gimp][gimp] and [Blender 3D][blender]. These days I use [Pixelmator][] for simple image editing because it feels so good on the Mac. For vector illustrations, [like the cover of this album](https://soundcloud.com/hirodusk/grid-cumulus "Another of Adam's albums on SoundCloud."), I find [Inkscape][] to be far more useable than Adobe Illustrator.

For creating music, [Logic Pro][logic-pro] is my main tool. [Audacity][] can't be beat for waveform editing despite not looking very pretty. And of course, I publish to [SoundCloud][].

I love reading, so I have to mention [Pocket][] (short form) and [Kindle][kindle-mac] (the app, not the hardware) for long-form. Kindle plus [GoodReads][] have amped up [my reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4706292-adam-wiggins "Adam's reading habits.") in a huge way. I'm very thankful to this combination of tools for making books a centerpoint in my life again.

Right now I'm trying to learn a new spoken language, so [Anki][] deserves a mention. This is a great flashcard authoring tool that syncs across platforms. Flashcards are a deceptively simple yet powerful tool for memorization.

#### What would be your dream setup?

Well, if we're really dreaming here, I'd like a computing setup like that shown in sci-fi movies (Star Trek, Iron Man, or Prometheus, to name a few). In these fictional environments, your computer follows you around everywhere, perhaps a little device in your pocket or pinned to your breast. But when you're in a workspace (like [Tony Stark's lab](http://www.artofvfx.com/?p=369 "An interview with Danny Yount on his Iron Man 2 work.")) it expands to fill all the space around you, via lots of monitors and audio equipment, or maybe a holographic display. This happens seamlessly and effortlessly, not some kind of docking procedure for your laptop or phone.

So my true dream setup would be a world of computing where your digital tools are at once everywhere and nowhere. The individual bits of hardware are tied together into a seamless whole that provides the perfect bridge between the digital world (the world of thought) and the physical world (the world of senses). Bret Victor's [Seeing Spaces](http://vimeo.com/97903574 "Bret's 'Seeing Spaces' video on Vimeo.") illustrates one possibility for what that might look like.

But that's kind of a big, far-off dream. So more realistically, um... maybe a phone with a longer battery life and the ability to uninstall iTunes from my Macbook?
