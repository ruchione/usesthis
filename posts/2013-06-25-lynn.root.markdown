#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I am [Lynn Root](http://www.roguelynn.com/ "Lynn's website.") and I am an engineer on the [freeIPA][] team at Red Hat working to integrate our [identity management](http://www.roguelynn.com/words/explain-like-im-5-kerberos/ "Lynn's post on Kerberos.") tools into other open source projects, [OpenShift's][openshift-origin] origin-server being the first/my latest.

I am also the founder of [PyLadies](http://www.pyladies.com/ "A mentorship group for girls interested in Python.") of [San Francisco](http://www.meetup.com/pyladiessf/ "The PyLadies SF meetups."). I give a lot of [talks](http://www.roguelynn.com/talks/ "Talks that Lynn has given."), live in the heart of San Francisco, and am a caffeine addict.

#### What hardware do you use?

For work, I have a [Lenovo T530][thinkpad-t530] that has 16GB RAM and 500GB hard disk space that I mostly keep at my office in Mountain View. It's hooked up to a 27" [Planar monitor][pxl2760mw] for funsies.

Yet my dream is the single machine – most of my development work is on my i7 13" [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] (sorry, boss!). It has 16GB RAM and 750GB of space. I'm content with just working on this machine all the time – no need for more monitor space. For Time Machine backups, I use a 1TB Seagate external hard drive.

I am an [Android][] fan; I use a Google Nexus (pre-[Nexus 4][nexus-4]) received from last year's Google I/O. It decently serves as my mp3 player and my camera as everything gets up/downloaded to/from "the cloud" automatically. I also scored a [Nexus 7][nexus-7] that facilitates a lot of [derping](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=derping "The Urban Dictionary definition for 'derping'.") around on whatever down time I have.

I have two [Raspberry Pis][raspberry-pi], one given graciously to me as a gift, and the other from PyCon's awesomeness, both a Model B. The first runs [Fedora 18 Remix][fedora] and the second runs a flavor of [Debian][].

For my caffeine addiction, I heat up water perfectly with a variable-temperature electric tea kettle from Breville, brew with an [Aeropress][], grind with a [Krups F203 electric grinder][f203-fast-touch-grinder], and store [my favorite coffee](http://www.bluebottlecoffee.com/ "San Francisco's Blue Bottle coffee roasters.") in a Friis vault.

#### And what software?

I write mostly in [Python][], and some [Ruby][], with everything in [git][] hosted on [GitHub][] for the majority of projects, [Fedora Hosted](https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/ "Fedora-hosted Git repositories.") for work, or a private [BitBucket][] for the non-OSS and the embarrassing. Everything is backed up daily on [Amazon S3][s3] with [Arq][]. I abuse free server space from a friend for my personal site, and use [GitHub Pages][github-pages] and [Heroku][] for other projects.

I code using [Vim][] and [Sublime Text 2][sublime-text] in [Vintage mode](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html "A vi-like mode for Sublime Text.") with some great plugins for git, [Markdown][], and [Dash][]. I switched [Terminal.app][terminal] for [iTerm2][], and left [bash][] for [zsh][] with a theme inspired by Steve Losh. With [oh-my-zsh][], I make use of many plugins for git, Sublime Text, [homebrew][], [virtualenv][], among others.

For working and testing on Fedora machines, I use [Vagrant][] with [VirtualBox][] for local VMs, and [Puppet][] when making use of [Red Hat’s Virtualization, oVirt][ovirt] for remote machines. For my VPN needs, for work I use [Tunnelblick][], otherwise [Cloak][] when I’m in the US, and [Hide My Ass][hide-my-ass] when abroad.

For talks, I use [Keynote.app][keynote] for slides, [Caffeine][] so my computer keeps awake during my whole talk, and publish on [slideshare][]. For blogging, I write with [Mou][] in Markdown and use [mynt][] to generate the HTML.

Rather than googling for documentation, I use Dash. It comes in handy for text snippets: I have ;o binded to ಠ_ಠ. With projects that use [Sphinx][] or [pydoctor][] for documentation, [doc2dash][] is a favorite tool.

When my attention span is short, or to archive awesome links for later, I use [Pinboard][]. I store passwords with [1Password][] and use [Knox][] for encrypted storage. I’ve migrating away from gmail to [FastMail][] for more control, privacy, and no ads.

I tweet with [Tweetbot][tweetbot-ios], or [Falcon Pro][falcon-pro-android] for my Android devices. I use [Mail.app][mail], manage my todos with [Reminders.app][reminders], chat on [Messages.app][messages] for GChat and [Linkinus][] for IRC, launch apps with [Alfred][], and listen to music with [Spotify][], or stream with [Rdio][] and [Pandora One][pandora-one] (can’t settle with one service!). My favorite little screen sharing tool is [Glui][]. I prefer eBooks, and read on my phone and tablet with the [Android Kindle app][kindle-ios]. With all those icons on my menu bar, I use [Bartender][].

#### What would be your dream setup?

I take notes the old-fashioned high school way: with post its, colored pens, and large paper. Even with the ability to all do it electronically, a desk that would just “know” to scan all notes and architecture docs I write would be **awesome**. That would also revive an old quirk of mine, drawing on sticky notes.

I can’t wait for Google Fiber to be local. And I’m number 1306 for [Google Glass][google-glass] – just giddy thinking of the data I’ll be able to track.
