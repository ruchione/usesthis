#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm a mortician and death acceptance advocate living in Los Angeles.

I just opened an alternative funeral home called [Undertaking LA](http://www.undertakingla.com/ "Caitlin's funeral home."), specializing in family involvement in caring for the dead body. I also run a group called [The Order of the Good Death](http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/ "Caitlin's order."), write books like *[Smoke Gets In Your Eyes: And Other Lessons from the Crematory](http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/smoke-gets-eyes "Caitlin's book.")*, and host a webseries called [Ask a Mortician](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi5iiEyLwSLvlqnMi02u5gQ "Caitlin's video series on YouTube.").

#### What hardware do you use?

This is going to shock some people (no one, it will shock no one) but I use a [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro]. Everything is done on that computer and if it dies my life would be over... which doesn't bode well for my acceptance of death.

All of my scheduling and note-taking is done analog in Moleskine notebooks.

For shooting my videos I use a [Canon Rebel T3i][eos-rebel-t3i] with a Rode Mic attached, but honestly my videos don't look much better than when I used to shoot on my laptop camera. Probably because I'm not using anything properly.

At my funeral home we use [PowerPak II retorts][power-pak-ii-plus] for cremation and all-natural willow and seagrass caskets for burial. Those count as hardware, right?

#### And what software?

I just designed my funeral home website on [Squarespace][]. Not that Squarespace counts as designing, I get that. I think it went well, but the bar for aesthetics on funeral home websites is SO low, you have no idea.

I edit in [iMovie][] which is ridiculous. I should have switched to Final Cut ages ago, but I'm a simple type of gal.

For writing I used to use [Microsoft Word][word], but for the book I'm working on now I've been writing in [Google Drive][google-drive], because I'm terrified of using a program that doesn't have autosave.

#### What would be your dream setup?

Dream setup is a cabin outside of LA that serves as a death think tank, library, video studio, writer's retreat, etc.  "If I only had the perfect space, all procrastination would be over" I tell myself, falsely.
