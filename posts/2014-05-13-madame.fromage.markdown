#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm a digital cheese courtesan. I [blog](http://madamefromageblog.com/ "Madame's weblog.") about cheese, offer pairing advice, and stage [delicious experiences](http://madamefromageblog.com/2013/cheese-ball-ii-a-cave-raising/ "Madame's post about a Cheese Ball.") - mostly around Philadelphia, where I live. Recently, I wrote a [racy cheese guide](http://www.amazon.com/Di-Bruno-Bros-House-Cheese/dp/0762446048 "Madame's cheese book.").  

In my earthly life, I teach and direct a [graduate writing program](http://www.sju.edu/int/academics/cas/grad/writingstudies/degreereq.html "The writing course at Saint Joseph's university.") at a university haunted by cheese-loving priests. My [desk](http://kokblog.johannak.com/6084/ "A post about creating a cheese desk.") is turbo-loaded with pairings to assuage their every craving.

#### What hardware do you use?

I'm partial to Peg and Awl cutting boards and cheese lovin' tea towels from [Girls Can Tell](http://girlscantell.com/products/cheese-lovers-tea-towel-set "A set of cheese lovers tea towels."). And I'm nothing without my cheese knives, my [Rebel T2i][eos-rebel-t2i], and Manfrotto 190 tripod. *I love to say Manfrotto*. 

I blog on a [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] and rely on my [iPhone][iphone-4s] for instant cheese updates via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MmeFromage "Madame on Twitter.") and [Instagram](http://instagram.com/mmefromage "Madame on Instagram."). I like knowing which cheeses are in season, what's ripening, and who's stocking what across the U.S.

My refrigerator - a key component in this world - is a fully stocked stainless steel Kenmore. The temperature controlled humidity drawers look like tide pools full of curious sea life at the moment - I just finished writing a story on spring goat cheeses for *The Philadelphia Inquirer*.

#### And what software?

The softer, the better, frankly. Lately, I'm into [*geotrichum* rinds](http://www.vermontcreamery.com/geotricum-cheese-new-to-america-steeped-in-french-tradition "A post about geotrichum rind cheeses."), which have wrinkly rinds like pug puppies. Allison Hooper at Vermont Creamery makes some flawless softies, like [Bonne Bouche](http://madamefromageblog.com/2013/sexy-wrinkled-cheese/ "Madame's post about Bonne Bouche."), a cheese so fuzzy and crazy that I dream of turning the rind into velvety wallpaper. 

I'm also having a mad love affair with [Tunworth](http://www.hampshirecheeses.co.uk/tunworth-cheese.asp "A cheese made in the UK."), a hopelessly gooey Camembert from southern England, of all places. And don't get me started on soft blues. Have you eaten [Chiriboga Blue](http://www.sfgate.com/food/cheesecourse/article/Chiriboga-Blue-unusual-cheese-from-Bavaria-5214587.php "An article about Chiriboga Blue cheese.")? It might as well be cheese gelato. I could lounge in bed all day and eat it with a tiny spoon.

#### What would be your dream setup?

I dream of: a traveling cheese valise. I am always lugging cheese boards around to parties, demos, tastings, classes, etc., and frankly, my setup is a crappy laptop bag and some ice packs. I travel mostly by train, so I fantasize about having a fabulous valise with special compartments for condiments, cheese wedges, and knives. When I arrive at my stop, I want to be able to snap the case open and set up a fabulous cheese board on the fly, complete with cloth napkins, a flask, and an array of snacksies.

I am working on a project with a [canning blogger](http://foodinjars.com/ "The Food in Jars website."), and we joke about traveling across the country together to host pop-up nibble fests - me with my cheese valise, she with her preserve-laden porta-pantry. One day!
