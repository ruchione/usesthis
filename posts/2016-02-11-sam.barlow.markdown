#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Sam Barlow. I've been making video games for about fifteen years -- as a Lead Designer, Writer and Game Director. I was previously best known for the 2009 [Wii][] game [Silent Hill: Shattered Memories][silent-hill-shattered-memories] or the 1999 text game [Aisle][], depending on who you spoke to. Last year I released my first independent game, [Her Story][her-story]. The game has done really well -- great reviews, great sales and it won awards at Indiecade, The Golden Joysticks and The Game Awards, amongst others!

#### What hardware do you use?

Her Story is a low-fi game in many ways, and that's probably true of my development setup too! I made the game in [Unity][] on my [Macbook Air][macbook-air]. I shot the video on a cheap Sony Handycam and then piped it to a couple of second hand VCR players via a [Proxima Direct PC VGA to TV Composite Video RGB Converter][pc-vga-to-tv-composite-video-rgb-converter]. I recorded and copied the footage back and forth a few times to introduce a little generation loss and then sucked it back into the Mac using a [VIDBOX for Mac][vidbox-mac]. The video setup was magic -- I lost several hours copying modern movies and games footage over onto VHS and enjoying the weird anachronistic sensation of seeing something from 2015 looking like it existed in the 90s. I felt it would be easier and more authentic to get the 'VHS' look from the real deal, rather than relying on post process effects.

For the game's sound effects I mixed up stuff downloaded from [Freesound.org][freesound] (a fabulous resource!) and bits that I captured myself with a [Zoom H1][h1] -- such as the sound of an old desktop PC fan, the key sounds of an ancient keyboard, etc. The Zoom H1 also helped as a productivity aid as I could give it to my kids to go play with and win myself a bit more dev time when I was being a house-husband.

#### And what software?

As I said, the game was developed in Unity -- which has its quirks, but is probably pound-for-pound the best option for indie game development! The footage was all edited in [Final Cut Pro][final-cut-pro] on the Macbook. That's a great piece of software and it sometimes felt like I was bringing a very large hammer to bear on a very small pin. 

I had some huge spreadsheets that I used to help balance the game and I switched between [Excel][], [Google Docs][google-docs] and [Pages][] depending on which crashed the most recently -- those spreadsheets were *huge*. I tracked all my tasks in [Trello][], which has the advantage of allowing me to check in on my phone and remind myself of all the work left to do at any time of the day, wherever I am. 

The script for the game was written in [Fade In][fade-in] -- previously I'd used [Movie Magic Screenwriter][movie-magic-screenwriter], but going indie I was forced to ask whether it was worth the asking price. Fade In is a slicker piece of software and at a fraction of the price. 

#### What would be your dream setup?

My needs are simple. What I've got, but with more memory and more hard-drive space. (My insistence of trying to dev off my Macbook saw me juggling several external hard-drives, one of which would insist on failing from time to time which helped keep things interesting.) To be honest, my dream setup would be more people -- grabbing a couple of coders to help me out when things get too technical would be worth any number of gadgets! Maybe a better coffee machine too :)
