#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Kathleen De Vere. I'm a writer, video editor, actor and illustrator for [LoadingReadyRun](http://www.loadingreadyrun.com/ "The LoadingReadyRun site."). I write and co-write for LoadingReadyRun and the [Friday Nights](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0662A5042C22EB03 "The Friday Nights series on YouTube.") series for Wizards of the Coast, and I edit lots of things including those videos and web-TV shows like [Strip Search](http://www.penny-arcade.com/strip-search/ "A reality game show for web cartoonists."), [Tabletop Deathmatch](http://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/deathmatch/ "A boardgame design contest.") and [Feed Dump](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/feed-dump "Videos of strange news stories."). I also draw the characters for LoadingReadyRun's [Pinny Arcade](http://penny-arcade.com/pinny-arcade/pins/ "A pin trading system.") pins and some of our [merchandise](http://store.loadingreadyrun.com/products/spoop-tee "The Spoop t-shirt on LoadingReadyRun."). I [tweet](https://twitter.com/Kathleen_LRR "Kathleen's Twitter account.") quite a bit too. 

#### What hardware do you use?

When I'm writing I just use [Google Docs][google-docs] on whatever computer I happen to be working at. I usually supplement that with some [Panasonic RP-HTX7-W1 Stereo Headphones][rp-htx7] (in white) and either [Rdio][] or my own music. I have been listening to Syro recently. Wait, does music count as hardware anymore? I suppose I need at least hardware to physically listen to it, so that's something. 

When I'm working at home, I use a hand-me-down 27" [iMac][]. It's from 2009, and being a jerk, I'm still running [10.8.5][mac-os-x]. I use a lot of older hardware in my personal life and I have learned that if you are using an older computer/phone/device any leap forward in operating system is usually means awful performance. That said in 2009 my computer was pretty boss, and it's got a 2.8 GHz processor and 16 GB of RAM. 

If I'm editing at the LoadingReadyRun office I use the brand new computer, a quad core trashcan [Mac Pro][mac-pro]! Honestly, the thing doesn't run as well as I'd like it to, considering the price. 

#### And what software?

I edit with [Final Cut Pro X][final-cut-pro-x] on both computers. If I'm drawing I'm very old fashioned and I draw onto Strathmore bristol board, with good mechanical pencils and Sakura microns. If I'm colouring I use copics, and if I'm colouring digitally I scan my lineart and clean it up in either [Photoshop][] or [Illustrator][].

#### What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup is very boring. All I would really like to add to what I already have is a good record player (and the space in my office for said record player, the speakers and amp required to use it.) But if I'm going to dream real big, I would love a [Cintiq][]. Why not a 22HD Touch? I don't use tablets, but I'd love to be able to cut out the pen and paper from my art process. It's only like, $3,000 Canadian.
