#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I am [Michelle Borkin](http://www.seas.harvard.edu/~borkin "Michelle's website.") ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/michelle_borkin "Michelle on Twitter.")) and I work on creating new approaches to interdisciplinary scientific visualization and data exploration. I co-founded the ["Astronomical Medicine" project](http://am.iic.harvard.edu/ "The Astronomical Medicine site.") at Harvard and collaborate with both astronomers and doctors to help them analyze and visualize their multidimensional data, and cross-fertilize visualization and analysis techniques across scientific disciplines. I am an Applied Physics PhD candidate at Harvard's [School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](http://www.seas.harvard.edu "The SEAS website.") and a [TED Fellow](http://www.ted.com/talks/michelle_borkin_can_astronomers_help_doctors.html "Michelle's TED talk, 'Can astronomers help doctors?'").

#### What hardware do you use?

Part of my work relates to applying stereographic 3D visualization techniques to my scientific data visualization projects. Since I like to keep things mobile, I have a [Sharp 3D laptop][actius-rd3d] with a [parallax barrier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_barrier "The Wikipedia entry for Parallax Barriers.") style screen. With this type of screen there is a "sweet spot" at the center where the image will pop-out in 3D, and no glasses are needed! (Not ideal for having multiple viewers, but good for on-the-go.) For when I'm not dashing around, my computer science office is equipped with a 73" Mitsubishi 3D TV with multiple shutter glasses for group viewing/watching. (A new Microsoft [Xbox 360][xbox-360] and [Kinect][] are ordered and on the way, too! Those are for researching how scientists could use hands-free interactions, with devices such as the Kinect, to explore and manipulate their data.)

On the "normal" hardware side of things, since I am constantly running between my two offices (one in the computer science department, the other in the astronomy department) and the Harvard Medical School, I like to carry my office with me thus I rely on my 15" [Macbook Pro][macbook-pro] (http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/), iPhone, and [iPad][ipad-2]. I also have external monitors in both of my offices (one is 24", the other 30"). Both offices are also outfitted with Mac [keyboards][keyboard], [mice][magic-mouse], and nifty [Griffin laptop stands][elevator] which simultaneously put the laptop screen at an ergonomic height/angle and keep the laptop cool.

#### And what software?

Since my daily bread-and-butter is visualization, here is the variety of what I use to get through my work every day: [Paraview][] for generally working with my 3D scientific data, [OsiriX][] and [3D Slicer][3d-slicer] for working with medical data, [APLpy][] and [ds9][] for viewing astronomical data (and the [WorldWide Telescope][worldwide-telescope] to figure out where/what I'm looking at!), [Processing][] for developing quick beautiful prototypes and interactive visualizations, and Adobe [Photoshop][] and [Illustrator][] for general 2D image editing and design.

In terms of more general use software, I use the usual run-down of stuff on the Mac (e.g., [Pages][], [Keynote][], etc.), [Papers][] for keeping all my PDFs organized, [Skype][] and [Basecamp][] for working with and keeping in touch with my collaborators, and any and everything Google (e.g., [Gmail][], [Google Docs][google-docs], etc.).

#### What would be your dream setup?

My dream set-up would definitely be some combo of the [AlloSphere](http://blog.ted.com/2009/04/15/tour_the_allosp/ "A TED talk on the AlloSphere."), and the [SixthSense][] wearable gestural interface.
