#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Nili Brosh](http://www.nilibrosh.com/ "Nili's website."), and I am an instrumental guitarist/composer. I have two albums out - "Through The Looking Glass" (2010) and "A Matter of Perception" (2014). I have a band that plays my original material live, and I'm also a freelance guitar player for several other bands/musicians (such as [The Iron Maidens](http://www.theironmaidens.com/ "A female Iron Maiden tribute band.") and [Tony MacAlpine](http://www.tonymacalpine.com/ "Tony's website.")).

#### What hardware do you use?

For my recording setup, I have an old-school [Motu UltraLite-mk3][ultralite-mk3] as my interface, with [KRK Rokit 8 monitors][rokit-8]. One of my favorite microphones to use is the [SE Electronics Voodoo VR1][voodoo-vr1], which I often use in conjunction with a [Sennheiser MD 421-II mic][md-421-ii] or a [Shure SM57][sm57]. As for my instruments, I have a variety of Ibanez 7-string guitars ([RG Prestige 2727FZ][rg-prestige-2727fz], [RG Premium 927][rg-premium-927], and an [RG Prestige 1527m][rg-prestige-1527m]. I use them through my [Peavey JSX Head][jsx-head] and [Egnater Tourmaster cabinet][tourmaster-4100]. I also run an [Xotic effects EP Booster pedal][ep-booster] through the front of the amp when recording.

#### And what software?

I use [Logic Pro X][logic-pro] as my DAW. I also use [Transcribe][] in order to facilitate my transcription and song learning process.

#### What would be your dream setup?

To be honest, I'm not sure I have a dream setup at the moment.. the setup I have isn't fancy, but I've tweaked it over the years to be able to get the exact tones I'm looking for when recording. I have to say that I am fairly satisfied with it at the moment, but I'm sure that as I make more records and my ears get more sensitive to smaller details, I will have new ideas for how I'd like to refine it further - both for my instruments and gear, as well as the recording setup itself.
