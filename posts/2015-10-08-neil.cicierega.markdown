#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Neil Cicierega](http://www.neilcic.com/ "Neil's website."), and I make all sorts of fun and silly media for the Internet. I started in 2001, when I was 14, with [Animutations](http://www.animutation.com/ "Neil's Flash animations."), a series of bizarre Flash animations that went viral and sparked a minor web art movement. I later created original music under the name [Lemon Demon](http://www.lemondemon.com/ "Neil's music."), and many [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/NeilCicierega "Neil's YouTube videos.") including the horribly popular [Potter Puppet Pals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx1XIm6q4r4 "Neil's Harry Potter puppet video."). Most recently I've created various [weird](http://www.windows95tips.com/ "Neil's serious Windows 95 tips.") [side](http://outslide.tumblr.com/ "Neil's SlideShare image collection.") [blogs](http://google-suggest.tumblr.com/ "Neil's collection og Google search suggestions."), and a pair of surreal mashup albums called [Mouth Sounds](http://www.neilcic.com/mouthsounds "Neil's mashup album.") and [Mouth Silence](http://www.neilcic.com/mouthsilence "Neil's other mashup album.").

I continue to make original music, YouTube videos, and animated GIFs. I have a Patreon [right here](https://www.patreon.com/NeilC "Neil's Patreon account.").

#### What hardware do you use?

My computer is a PC with an Intel Core i7 920 2.66G, 12GB of RAM, and an [NVIDIA Quadro K2000][quadro-k2000] graphics card. I built it myself a few years ago based on a guide for an editing rig. My main monitor is a 23-inch [Samsung SyncMaster][syncmaster-2343bwx]. For the sound card, I have an [M-Audio Delta 1010lt][delta-1010lt], which has all its inputs and outputs hanging out the back of the PC like spaghetti. I feel like a serious hacker when I plug anything in. On my desktop, I have a [Klipsch ProMedia 2.1][promedia-2.1] speaker system and [Audio-Technica ATH-M50][ath-m50] headphones.

For recording MIDI, I have a [M-Audio Axiom 61 key controller][axiom-61]. For recording audio, to avoid computer noise, I have a bundle of 25-foot cables -- monitor, USBs, audio -- running to a separate room where there's a second monitor, keyboard, mouse, a [Marshall MXL V67G][mxl-v67g] condenser mic going through a [PreSonus TubePRE][tubepre] for vocals, and some older junkier Creative computer speakers. I also have a [Behringer AMP800][amp800] on my desktop to quickly patch audio output between the two stations. (And the Win-P key to switch screens quickly.) For a laptop I have a 15-inch [Toshiba][satellite-radius-p55w-b5318].

My camera is a [Canon EOS 7D][eos-7d]. I bought it when DSLRs were an
exciting new concept and it's served me really well. I never use the stock lens, but I have a [Tamron AF 17-50mm f/2.8][af-17-50mm-f2.8-xr-di-ii-ld], [Sigma 24mm f/1.8][24mm-f1.8-ex-dg], and a [Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8][11-16mm-f2.8-at-x116-pro-dx] which seem to work for what I shoot. I use knockoff batteries, and Kingston 16GB memory cards (the ones I have seem to be discontinued.) My tripod is a [Manfrotto 701HDV head][701hdv-pro-fluid-video-mini-head] on [055XPROB legs][055xprob], which have a neat feature for pointing the camera straight down at the floor which can come in handy for things like animation. I have a wall with a [green screen][chroma-key-green] pinned up. For lights I usually just use cheap clamp lights.

For portable audio recording I use a [Zoom H4n digital recorder][h4n], and a [Rode NTG2 shotgun mic][ntg2]. When I'm filming myself, I attach a [Lilliput 7-inch LCD monitor][668gl-70np-h-y] and flip it forwards. I have a cheap Fender Squier guitar, which I usually plug directly in to use with amp sim software. I have tons of little instruments and synths, an electric violin from a yard sale, and maracas from Aruba with Bart Simpson painted on them. I carry Moleskine reporter-style notebooks, which are nicer when you're left-handed, and a [Samsung Galaxy Note 3][galaxy-note-3]. I share an [Epson R2000 printer][stylus-photo-r2000] with my wife, who's a [comic book artist](http://www.mingdoyle.com/ "Ming's website."), and we both make large art prints to sell at conventions and the like.

#### And what software?

[Windows 7][windows-7] Professional, 64-bit. I make my music in [Cakewalk Sonar][sonar] X3 Producer. I've been using their software since I was a kid. My dad's a guitarist and he always had a version installed, so I learned on that. Most instruments and effects I use are VST plugins. [Toontrack EZdrummer][ezdrummer] for drums, [Kontakt][] for high-quality sample packs, and freeware like [Synth1][] for most synths, [Fretted][fretted-synth] and [LePou's](http://lepouplugins.blogspot.com/ "Leo's plugin website.") guitar amp sims, and much, much more... There's a huge amount of useful and fun plugins out there, and [many are free](http://bedroomproducersblog.com/free-vst-plugins/ "An article about the best free VST plugins."). Oh, [Celemony's Melodyne][melodyne] pitch correction, maybe. [Adobe Audition][audition] for mastering and various audio manipulations.

For video and graphics, I'm still on [Adobe Creative Suite 5][creative-suite]. [Photoshop][] all the time. [Premiere Pro][premiere-pro] for video editing. A lot of my video projects [rely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvrCoDZUwRg "Neil's Goosebumps video on YouTube.") [heavily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAsPeY8BsQU "Neil's MOUTH video on YouTube.") on [After Effects][after-effects].

I'm currently making [a game](https://twitter.com/iconarchitect10 "Neil's game's Twitter account.") as a side project in [Adventure Game Studio][adventure-game-studio], which I last used when I was 15, with pixel art made in [Aseprite][] and [GrafX2][].

[Gmail][], [Twitter][], [Tumblr][], [Facebook][]. [Amazon Prime][amazon-prime]. I use [TuneCore][] to submit my music to online stores, [Bandcamp][] for a self-managed [music store](http://lemondemon.bandcamp.com/ "Neil's Bandcamp store."), and [SoundCloud][] to host questionable [mashups](https://soundcloud.com/neilcic "Neil's SoundCloud account.").

I browse with many tabs open in [Chrome][], and usually have an Incognito window open as a scratchpad for incessant Googling whims. I don't know how I worked before [Dropbox][] or avoided headaches before [f.lux][]. I replaced notepad.exe with [Flo's Notepad2][notepad2]. I have most Windows system sounds turned off, and my desktop is blank white with "Show desktop items" permanently unchecked -- I access everything from pinned taskbar icons, or by clicking Start and typing the first few letters. My default media player is still [Windows Media Player][windows-media-player], or [VLC][] for trickier formats. I have [iTunes][] but never, ever use it. At my wedding this year, I ran our whole playlist on [Winamp][].

I make system backups with [Acronis True Image][true-image]. I also keep backups of old hard drives dating back to the mid-90s, so I'll have those grade school book reports and extremely bad attempts at fiction with me forever.

#### What would be your dream setup?

The one I've got is cobbled together in a sloppy, mismatched fashion, but I don't think any other kind will ever suit me. I work in all media, rarely focusing on one thing over the course of a day, so I like having everything I need on one system, and all my stuff within arm's reach. My dream setup would probably just be more stuff.
