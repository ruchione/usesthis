#### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Hiné [hee-neh] Mizushima](http://www.hinemizushima.com/ "Hiné's website."), and I am a super-slow crafter who currently lives in Vancouver, Canada with my family. I was born and raised in Japan, and I majored in Japanese traditional paintings at my art university in Tokyo.

My main work is [felt sculpture (needle-felting)](http://www.hinemizushima.com/72050/felt-sculptures "Hiné's sculptures."). I like to make squids octopi, bugs, microbes, mushrooms and dolls, etc. I also make stop-motion animation music videos (mostly for [They Might Be Giants](https://www.behance.net/gallery/8439009/Video-Insect-Hospital "Hiné's TMBG video on Behance."), [dioramas](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25898041/Cephalopod-Anatomy-Class "Hiné's anatomy diorama on Behance.") and [miniature collages](http://www.hinemizushima.com/335608/miniature-collage "Hiné's felt collages.") using my felt sculptures. My work has been exhibited in galleries in many cities, and published in books, magazines and on DVDs as well. I sell my felt creations and prints on [my Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/hine "Hiné's Etsy store."), and I also have a Society6 [art print & goods shop](http://society6.com/hine "Hiné's Society6 store.").

#### What hardware do you use?

I just realized that I don't use much hardware, because my work is mostly handmade!

I use an [iMac][] (27-inch), iPad, [iPhone 5s][iphone-5s], and of course, a [Super Low-Tech Apple Watch][super-low-tech-apple-watch]! I use my iPhone as a camera, instead of a phone. Also, I often use my Nikon DSLR and Coolpix digital camera, but they're old and not great quality any more. I need a new one!

I have a Canon printer for printing my prints and stuff for my shop, and I also have a "3D Printer" [like this](https://www.behance.net/gallery/2990737/GIF-Animation-3D-Printer "Hiné's 3D 'printer' on Behance."). I recently bought a new Canon scanner, but I actually don't use it much. I also got a [Wacom Intuos Pen & Touch][intuos] last year, but it's been sleeping on my book shelf for a long time..

For crafting, I use [these tools](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sheishine/16046525941/ "A Flickr photo of Hiné's felt tools."). I also use sketchbooks and pencils for writing/drawing my ideas, directly from my brain.

I got a [Kindle][] last year as a gift. Now I finally can buy and read Japanese books anytime via Kindle (there's no Japanese book store in Vancouver). That's so wonderful!

#### And what software?

I use [Adobe Photoshop][photoshop] almost everyday for fixing up photographs of my work, but I'm totally at beginner level. Sometimes I use [Illustrator][] too, for making illustrations, miniature props, and my shop cards, tags, stickers, etc.

When I work on stop-motion music videos, I use [Final Cut Express][final-cut-express] (yes, it's very very old..).

I love [Instagram](https://instagram.com/sheishine/ "Hiné's Instagram account."), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sheishine/ "Hiné's Flickr account.") and [iPhoto][]. I use them everyday.

#### What would be your dream setup?

I love [my home studio](https://www.etsy.com/seller-handbook/article/inspiring-workspaces-hine/22265183158 "An Etsy interview with Hiné.") but it's tiny, so I want a bigger one. I wish I could have a second big desk there, exclusively for photographing and cutting papers & fabrics.

I really want to get a [Cricut Explore Air Wireless Cutting Machine][explore-air-wireless] now. It might be very useful for my craft work. In the future, I want to own a laser cutting machine, too.

I also need a new a DSLR camera (hopefully a [Nikon D5300][d5300]) and a Horizontal Camera Mount, as well as a better tripod, especially for miniature collage work.

And I wish I had more arms, like an octopus, so I could work faster!
