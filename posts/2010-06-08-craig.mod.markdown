InDesign and Lightroom are probably two of my favorite Adobe's products. Although InDesign is feeling more and more bloated. Lightroom is 'dreamy.' I'm hoping Adobe keeps Lightroom as lean and mean as possible moving forward. (Dear Adobe, tip: all us creatives really want now is faster more stable software.)

I use Code Igniter because it's what I know and can go from idea to working prototype in a matter of hours / days. It's light and nice.

I've come to know the quirks of Coda (and I know I am losing so much programmer street cred. by revealing I use such a 'dainty' editor). Although I wish they would release an even daintier version. 70% of the program I don't use. The core 30% is wonderful though.

Try and try as I might, I simply haven't been able to fall in love with [BBEdit][]. I have owned and upgraded my copy for the last decade though.

I would use [Textmate][] but need real Japanese language support. Also, I like my software to be updated ... ever.

#### What would be your dream setup?

An iPad with: more internal storage; a higher density (300ppi+) screen; wireless cellular worldwide broadband 4G/5G/10G/etc; battery that lasts a month on one charge; real cloud storage for everything, always synced and always replicated around the world; an ebooks app that truly embraces the advantages of digital for the reader.

[Leica M9][m9] with 50mm f/0.95 [Noctilux][noctilux-m] + 35mm f/1.4 [Summilux-m][summilux-m] + bodyguard to protect me as I carry around close to $20,000 in camera equipment.

A 'creation' computer with the same specs as my 13" MacBook Pro plus a huge SSD drive (1TB+) all in the form factor of a MacBook Air.
