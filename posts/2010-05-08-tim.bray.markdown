#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I've been at Google since March 15th; my title is "Developer Advocate" currently working on Android-related stuff. But really I'm a general-purpose Internet geek. Seems to me that the Net is still at the center of everything that matters.

If I die without discovering the cure for the common cold or bringing peace to the Middle East, my gravestone will say I'm this guy who helped invent [XML](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/ "The XML spec."), because [I did](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/02/10/XML-People "Tim's post on XML."), about 100 years ago. You still can't beat XML for interchanging documents over the Net.

Most of the software I've written over the years was closed-source and is thus out of sight, but there are [a few bits and pieces](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Software "Software written by Tim.") visible. Since 2004, I've written more than a million words on [my blog](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/ "Tim's weblog.").

#### What hardware do you use?

I just got a new 13" [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro]; small and light and with an SSD. It's slick, has FireWire and an SD card reader. I'm very happy except that the SSD is only 113G so I have to carry around an outboard disk for my pictures.

In the living room at home we have a big honkin' dual-quad-core [Mac Pro][mac-pro] meat-grinder, a couple years old now, for media work. In the basement there's a [Windows 7][windows-7] box because there are a few Windows things one needs to do, and its drivers for our [Canon i9900 photo printer][i9900] are way better. [My wife](http://laurenwood.org/ "Lauren's website.") is a geek too, so there are 5 or 6 more computers around the house.

Also at home is a high-end audio system (Linn, Simon Yorke, Simaudio, Totem) that I drive from either the analog turntable or the Mac Pro, where there are about [a thousand CDs worth of music ripped](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/06/12/Music-Migration-Done "Tim's post on ripping his CDs."). I take digital audio out through a [Benchmark DAC1 USB][dac1-usb]; the sound is wonderful. In my office, I have an outboard USB disk with a backup of all that ripped music; I take USB audio out of the laptop into a dinky little [KingRex USB DAC][ud-01] and drive a funky [Cary Rocket 88][rocket-88] tube amplifier into very old but pretty good Totem speakers; I acknowledge that this setup verges on the perverse.

In my office I plug a 24" Sun display, an Apple outboard keyboard, and some Logitech mouse into the MacBook. At home we have a [NEC 2690 display][multisync-2690] that I bought on [James Duncan Davidson's recommendation](http://blog.duncandavidson.com/2008/03/nec-2690wuxi-first-impressions.html "James' article on the monitor."), carefully color-corrected; it makes our pictures and videos look much better than they really are. It's plugged into the Mac Pro and occasionally the laptop.

For many years, off in the back rooms at Sun I had a [SPARC T2000][sun-fire-t2000] that I use to run concurrency experiments of [one kind](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/05/01/Wide-Finder-2 "Tim's post on Wide Finder 2.") and [another](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/09/27/Concur-dot-next "Tim's posts on Concurrent Programming."). I'll need something at Google to replace that. I carry around a [Nexus One][nexus-one] Android phone.

#### And what software?

I'd like to use Free Software but I'm addicted to [Keynote][], [Lightroom][], suspend/resume that Always Just Works, and a competent outboard-display manager.

Creative time is spent in [Aquamacs][] Emacs (blogging, coding in languages with poor IDE support like [Perl][] and [Erlang][]), [Eclipse][] ([Android][] development), [NetBeans][] ([Java][], [Ruby][], [Clojure][], and [C][] development), and [Gmail][] (via a [Fluidized][fluid] Safari).

I use [Camino][] for browsing, [Adium][] for chat, [Colloquy][] for IRC, [NetNewsWire][] for watching the feeds, and [Tweetie][] for Twitter. Lightroom for photos with some [Photoshop Elements][photoshop-elements]. [Terminal.app][terminal] with a beige background and 12 point Courier New Bold. I don't use [screen][](1) or tabs, just lots of Terminal windows. My shell is [bash][] and I often pop up [Vim][] for quickie file changes, particularly on remote hosts. Which doesn't mean that [Emacs][] isn't the One True Editor.

I wrote a [big long blog post](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/08/27/How-To-Use-The-Dock "How Tim uses the Dock.") on how I organize and use OS X.

On the Android I use mostly the built-in stuff. Then there's [Twidroid][twidroid-android] for Twitter, [Connectbot][connectbot-android] for ssh, and [Tunes remote][tunesremote-android] for controlling music at home. I pay for [Spanning Sync][spanning-sync], thus my contacts and schedule up to date on the Mac, on Google, and on the Android phone. It's really magic. I use [doubleTwist][] to move music from the Mac to the Android; it's only OK.

On the server, everything I work on seems to involve some combination of [Debian][] Linux or [OpenSolaris][], Apache [httpd][], Ruby, [Rack][], and [MySQL][]. I prefer Ruby to all other programming languages although I'm probably more proficient in C, and have a big soft spot for Erlang.

#### What would be your dream setup?

I'd like my computer to be lighter and faster, my screen to be bigger and brighter and have better color, Mac OS X and its apps to be open-source, and to have whatever the hot Android phone of 2 years from now is going to be.

I'd really like high-quality cyborg cameras integrated into my visual system so I can take photographs of what I see in an instant just by thinking about it.
