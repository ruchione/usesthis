#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Charlie Loyd, and I'm on the satellite imagery team at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/ "A mapping company."). With my teammates, I've worked on projects like [Cloudless Atlas](http://www.wired.com/2013/05/a-cloudless-atlas/ "A WIRED article about MapBox's satellite imagery."), [Landsat Live](http://www.citylab.com/design/2015/03/roam-the-earth-in-real-time/388252/ "A CityLab article about MapBox's real-time satellite imagery."), [disaster response](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/nepal-imagery-collection/ "Charlie's MapBox's post about map data collection and disasters."), and [maintaining the basemap](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/new-zealand-aerial/ "Charlie's MapBox post about New Zealand."). I also [tweet too much](https://twitter.com/vruba "Charlie's Twitter account.") about Earth observation, tamales, and the common names of plants and animals; write [a similarly diffuse newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/vruba "Charlie's newsletter."), increasingly irregularly; and am [looking for Space Shuttle tile records](http://shuttletiles.space "Charlie's space shuttle tiles website.").

I made [Glittering Blue](https://glittering.blue/ "Charlie's Earth animation site.").

#### What hardware do you use?

At work we're on small [MacBook Pros][macbook-pro] with maxed-out RAM and external monitors on standing desks. What matters is the RAM, for ridiculous images - mural-size TIFFs that were never meant to be viewed directly. The laptops are scratchpads and network terminals. Production code runs in a datacenter [somewhere](http://creativetimereports.org/2014/05/20/ingrid-burrington-the-cloud-is-not-the-territory-wnv/ "An article about data centers in northern Virginia."), on hardware that must generate the heat and sound of an overloaded A380 flying straight up. We're carbon-neutral, so I assume we've funded an entire forest somewhere.

At home, I've just given up on a mid-2010 15" MacBook. I'd patched it with an SSD (and thermochromic microbeads to [see where it gets hottest](https://twitter.com/vruba/status/627895234765000704 "Charlie's tweet showing the hot patches on his laptop.")), but it's not up to everyday use anymore. So I got the tiniest Macbook and [a wee little bag][campus-messenger]. The lappy is underpowered, almost portless, and impossible to upgrade - just a typewriter made out of Unix. It's great so far.

Also with me when walking around: An [Anker battery][astro-6700], an iPhone (sometimes daubed with retroreflective beads in a nail gloss matrix, for in-pocket orientation and grip), and [a Bad Elf logger][gps-pro-plus] with location and barometry. The [Everlane Twill Snap][twill-snap] is a bit _Kinfolk_/VSCO but it works. I've been alternating between the [yacht-sail wallet][wa-ben] that William Gibson [tipped](http://boingboing.net/2011/09/01/william-gibson-interview-boing.html "A Boing Boing interview with Willian Gibson.") and the [Hello Kitty Tyvek][hello-kitty-tyvek-mighty]. My favorite notebook to rarely use is a Rhodia webnotebook, but most of what I do handwrite and doodle is on folded-up charcoal paper. [Bic Cristals][cristal-xtra-smooth] are light, safe to carry loose in a bag, not blotty, and more expressive than most expensive pens. [Faber-Castell Pitts][pitt] when I'm feeling zhooshy. (Incidentally, for printmaking and large papercraft, the trick is to go in with friends on a giant shipment of Rives BFK.)

On the camera shelf: A [Nikon FE][fe] and a [50mm f/1.4 Nikkor-S][50mm-f1.4-nikkor-s-auto] - a half-century-old manual lens that's sharp, affordable, and has pleasingly old-fashioned flares. It's sometimes attached to a Canon DSLR (occasionally running [Magic Lantern][magic-lantern]), which has Canon non-L primes and a few toys. And the silly one: a [Mamiya RZ67 II][rz67-professional-ii], a medium format film camera from the '90s, with the [110mm f/2.8][rz67-110mm-f2.8]. That lens.. üòç.

#### And what software?

[Safari][] is my web browser. It doesn't support WebP or every HTML5 feature yet, but it's reliable, clean, and fast. I'm biased toward vanilla apps. I fear the brittleness of overoptimized workflows.

Most of my client side software that doesn't come with [OS X ][mac-os-x] is open source, for all the obvious reasons. (Especially reproducibility. I get questions about geo image processing workflows, and advice in terms of free tools is much more accessible.) I do have [Photoshop][], just as a fancy viewer, and [Lightroom][]. Like many people who've been broke, I'm permanently wary of subscriptions for things that feel more like objects than like services - that's how you get nickel and dimed. Paying for quality up front feels fine: for example, [Triplicate](http://practicaltypography.com/triplicate.html "A monospaced font.") makes monospaced reading almost painless. ([Fira Sans](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira "A monospaced font.") for headers and [as a free web font](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Fira+Sans "The Fira Sans font available for web use on Google's font service.").)

Text typed on my own behalf starts as [Markdown][]. I do my coding and writing in [TextMate][], which looks [like this](http://basecase.org/2015/12/textmate "Charlie's TextMate screenshot."). It's not the most flexible or powerful, but the dominant limit on my productivity is my brain, not my text editor. The system-wide text bindings are handy - for example, `ctrl-{k,y}` provide a limited second clipboard.

For programming: [Python][]! Lots of [`numpy`][numpy], a library for math on n-dimensional arrays (like images). To socket it onto our work, my teammates wrote [`rasterio`][rasterio], which moves data neatly among `numpy`, GDAL, and georeferenced images.

[Wolfram Alpha][wolfram-alpha] for [Fermi estimates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem "The Wikipedia entry for Fermi problem."). [iD][] for editing [OpenStreetMap][] - again, it's not [The Homer](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/The_Homer?file=TheHomer.png "An image of the car Homer Simpson invented.") of OSM editors, but its friction is so low that I can pop in and trace for 90 seconds without breaking stride. On a fresh computer, I install [`geojsonio`][geojsonio-cli], [`htop`][htop], [`parallel`][parallel], [`pv`][pv], [`netcat`][netcat], [`postgresql`][postgresql], [`unison`][unison], [`tmux`][tmux], and [`zsh`][zsh]. `pb{copy,paste}` are useful GUI-CLI bridges.

On [iOS][]: The apps I recommend most are [Signal][signal-ios], [Spectrogram Pro][spectrogram-pro-ios], [SensorLog][sensorlog-ios], [Barograph][barograph-ios], [Dark Sky][dark-sky-ios], [VesselTracker][vesseltracker-ios], and [iFlares][iflares-ios]. I still like [Twitter][twitter-ios] and I'm fine with [Instagram][instagram-ios], but [Taptalk][] is my favorite social network right now: personal, ambiguous, ephemeral.

#### What would be your dream setup?

Obviously, vision into ultraviolet and infrared is the big thing. Finer spectral resolution is also a persistent need, to get more perceived colors and fewer [metamers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_%28color%29 "The Wikipedia entry for Metamerism (colour).").

A writing app with a proportional font, [git][] and Markdown integration, and a curly quote algorithm that gets "rock 'n' roll 7‚Ä≥s from the '80s" right. (Miss you, [Editorially][].)

Look, just an [iPhone 4S][iphone-4s] with upgraded guts and a few material/shape tweaks. All the half-tablet, half-plastic, half-day smartphones lately are fine or whatever I guess. We can all imagine something better, something that you heft and instantly understand that a dozen Kraftwerk-lookin' nerds left Leica by dirigible for a hilltop studio in San Miguel de Allende to design it with Rotring pens under the codirection of Tomita Mikiko and Ben Osawe. I speak for millions, probably tens of millions. But instead we get these phones that feel slightly ahead of themselves.

Too many of my daily tools are overfitted. What could I be using that's not designed by and for affluent Anglophone citydwellers pretty much like me? I want to be learning more from my gear. One of my favorite designers is a blacksmith, Jim Wester, who makes blades for woodworking. Carvers all over the world use his adzes and knives. As a lark, sometimes he makes [cutlery](http://www.northbayforge.com/cutlery.htm "Cutlery made by Jim Wester."), and I have one of his paring knives. It breaks all sorts of kitchen knife norms: it's obviously not designed by a chef. You sharpen it at a shallow angle, because it has an idiosyncratic bevel; its handle expects a slightly different motion than you do; it's tool steel, not stainless, so you have to worry about rust - and so on. It's weird. And I expect to use it and love it until, many years from now, I wear it out. It cuts like a cartoon laser. Its weirdness comes from the hand and mind of a master, and it's precious to me. My dream setup has more of that feeling.
