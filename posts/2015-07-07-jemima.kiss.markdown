#### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name's [Jemima Kiss](http://www.jemimakiss.com/ "Jemima's website.") and [I'm](http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jemimakiss "Jemima's Guardian profile page.") the head of the [Guardian's technology](http://www.theguardian.com/us/technology/ "The technology section of the Guardian.") editorial team. I'm based in London but live in rural Sussex, hence spending a lot of time on trains.

#### What hardware do you use?

I jump between devices and brands but at the moment am using an [iPhone 6 Plus][iphone-6-plus]. It has replaced a tablet for me, especially at home on the sofa when I don't want to get a laptop out in the evenings. It took about 30 minutes to get used to the size and I can't imagine having a smaller phone again, unless it's some kind of supercool screenless voice command unit. I AM WAITING. Patiently.

I also use a [MacBook Air][macbook-air] between home and work, and use an external second screen with it at work. It's a binny old HP screen we seem to have a lot of here.. and a third screen for good measure, which is one of our very creaky [iMacs][imac], though I only use that for monitoring our own site. So it looks like a three-screen set up, but actually not so impressive..

#### And what software?

I try and do as much in the cloud as possible because of the security. < Joke.

But actually I do, because I don't want to be shafted when I eventually leave my laptop on the train, which will happen. I use [Chrome][] heavily, and then the usual - [Twitter][] (I'm one of the rare few who prefers their own desktop client), then [Slack][] (we love it) and the usual [Notes][] and [iCal][] etc. It was the world's biggest ballache syncing Google and Apple calendars and software, defeating even the kind but clueless guy at the Genius Bar, but I finally sussed it out.

#### What would be your dream setup?

5k retina. One day I can have two 5k screens, but I'd settle for two separate machines just so I could have the two screens. Dell does a 5k screen though, so that might do for the meantime..
