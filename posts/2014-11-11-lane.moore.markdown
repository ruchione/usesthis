#### Who are you, and what do you do?

[I'm](http://www.lanemoore.org/ "Lane's website.") a stand-up comedian, filmmaker, actor, writer/editor, and musician. I write for places like The Onion, McSweeney's, Cosmopolitan, Someecards, I'm a commentator on VH1, MTV, Huffington Post Live talking head shows, and I'm a former editor for Jezebel. I'm the creator, producer, writer, director, music composer and star of comedy web series [Gold Stars](https://www.youtube.com/user/GoldStarsSeries/videos "Lane's comedy web series on YouTube."). Season 2 is currently in pre-production and if you'd like to give us money please give us money.

I'm also the producer and host of the monthly [Tinder Live!](http://www.lanemoore.org/tinder-live/ "Lane's comedy show.") comedy variety show in NYC, producer and host of podcast, [Are You Afraid Of The Snark?](https://www.facebook.com/AreYouAfraidOfTheSnark "The Facebook page for Lane's podcast."), which is a thing where myself and comedians and writers from The Onion, The Colbert Report, VH1, MTV, and even former cast members themselves join in mocking the 1990â€²s Nickelodeon TV show [*Are You Afraid Of The Dark?*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_Afraid_of_the_Dark%3F "The Wikipedia entry for 'Are You Afraid Of The Dark?'.") in the form of a podcast. Listeners can then sync up the running commentary track with each episode. It is the greatest. 

I also [tweet](https://twitter.com/hellolanemoore "Lane's Twitter account.") a lot.

#### What hardware do you use?

For my Tinder Live shows, I use an iPad hooked up to a weirdo cable hooked up to a projector and all of this happens atop a rickety ladder. It's pretty interesting to watch. I have a [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] that, while only a year old, does not move as quickly as I'd like it to. I use that for everything I do.

For my Are You Afraid Of The Snark? podcast, we use a series of microphones that are not mine and use a splitter to connect 4 sets of headphones to the sound from my roommate's television that is an actual television and not a computer that plays TV shows and basically sit around on my couch making jokes while it streams live.

For my band, [It Was Romance](https://www.facebook.com/itwasromance "The Facebook page for Lane's band."), I have a [Shure 58A microphone][beta-58a] that I hook up to a preamp that goes into my computer which goes into [GarageBand][]. I have a Marshall mini amp that is much louder than its size would indicate and I have two electric ukuleles that I hook up to Boss distortion pedals and a [Big Muff pedal][big-muff]. I also have a red bass guitar, a mini accordion, a 1960s xylophone, a toy piano, and some good headphones, but I feel like there are way better headphones out there. I'm obsessed with the idea of finding the perfect headphones. 

#### And what software?

I know everyone I talk to uses [Microsoft Word][word] but my copy of it stopped working ages ago and I hate opening up documents so I just write everything in [Gmail][] drafts. Not even in [Google Docs][google-docs]. Just in email drafts. I had no idea this was super weird until a fellow comedy writer friend saw me do that and literally said, "Whoa" like it was otherworldly.

I use [Final Cut][final-cut-pro] to edit the web series, GarageBand to edit music (even though I've heard [Logic][] is 4 million times better), and I use simple websites to create my show flyers, which I think actually look really professional.

#### What would be your dream setup?

An actual recording, filming, and editing studio. Really just a pile of money would be cool. I do so many DIY/low budget things and it'll be really neat to see and hear what I can do once I get really great equipment. I'm excited for that.
