#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Alice Bartlett](http://www.alicebartlett.co.uk/ "Alice's website."). I've just left my job as a Senior Developer at the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/ "The UK government's main website.") in the UK, to start working for the [Financial Times](http://www.ft.com/home/uk "The UK version of the Financial Times."). Mostly I write HTML/CSS and [JavaScript][]. I like the bit of the web where code meets humans.

I also sew my own clothes sometimes - results at [sewing.butt.kitchen](http://sewing.butt.kitchen/ "Alice's sewing site."). I'm also the founder of lady-bung empowerment franchise [Tampon Club](http://www.tampon.club/ "A community group providing tampons for offices.").

#### What hardware do you use?

I use a [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015). I have a blue [iPhone 5c][iphone-5c] which I bought because I like the colour. I have a 7 year old 80GB [iPod Classic][ipod-classic] with a photo of a dog in a wig stuck to the back of it. It has all the music I've owned since I was 17 on it, which is a crazy idea now I think about it. Just carrying 10 years worth of digital files around with you everywhere you go. I have a [Kindle][].

I use [Bullet Journaling][bullet-journal] to keep track of stuff at work. I've been doing it for about 6 months and it's really helped me to focus on what I'm supposed to be doing and not do the other unimportant stuff.

My sewing machine is an [E & R Classic][classic-kpn400] which was a 21st birthday present from my best friend. It's old and clunky and I've lost the manual, so I'm rather winging it with keeping it working at this point.

There isn't a lot of hardware involved in Tampon Club, unless you count tampons.

#### And what software?

I use [OS X][mac-os-x]. I use [Atom][] for code editing. I'm not sure I love it, but it gets the job done. It's pretty wild that my code editor is written in JavaScript - I guess that just means I'm old.

I have very pedestrian tastes in software: [Twitter for Mac][twitter-mac], [Chrome][], and I love [Instagram][instagram-ios]. It's the social network where people show their best selves. I get to see things my friends have made, places they're visiting, funny visual gags. I use [Tumblr][] for sharing things I've sewn.

I'm still sad about [Google Reader][google-reader]. I use [The Old Reader][the-old-reader] to keep up with my friend's blog posts now, but it's not as good.

I wrote my personal site in [Ruby][] using [Sinatra][]. It's a very rudimentary blog.

#### What would be your dream setup?

I'd like a better phone camera. Not enough to buy a better phone, but if we're dreaming.

I'd like a Serger for sewing jersey. Although I sew a lot of clothes for myself, I am a terrible slob, and the kinds of slovenly clothes slobs like (stretchy) are actually difficult to sew at home on a normal sewing machine.

I'd like a better sewing machine. My E & R is a bit of a weakling, it can't sew denim or with thick threads, and it drops stitches a lot.
