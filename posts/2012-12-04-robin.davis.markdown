#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Robin Camille Davis](http://www.robincamille.com/ "Robin's website.") ([@robincamille](https://twitter.com/robincamille "Robin on Twitter.")), and I am the new Emerging Technologies and Distance Services Librarian at [John Jay College of Criminal Justice](http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/ "The library's website.") in New York City. I research effective distance librarianship practices and look at ways new tech can aid learning and discovery. I also build and test websites and digital resources to support student learning, both on - and off - campus. Currently, we are redesigning the main library website and migrating everything into [Drupal][]. I am a managing co-editor of the [DH Curation Guide](http://guide.dhcuration.org/ "The DH Curation Guide's site."), a community resource for data curation in the digital humanities.

#### What hardware do you use?

I use an [iMac][] and 11" [MacBook Air][macbook-air] for work, and a 15" [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] at home. I also keep a Dell in my office, although at this point I mainly use it for testing. I use an [iPad 2][ipad-2] (in a Dodocase) mostly to read PDFs and when traveling to conferences. My [iPhone 5][iphone-5] is a fifth extremity. 

As Jerome McDonough puts it, everything digital dies. To that end, I back everything up onto two local external hard drives, a [Western Digital 2TB][elements-desktop] and a 1TB Seagate. I do this on a weekly basis, and it has saved my butt twice. (More on backup later.)

For reading, I use a [Kindle 2][kindle], though my preferred platform remains paperbacks! (Fave local bookstores: [McNally Jackson](http://mcnallyjackson.com/ "The website of a bookstore in New York City.") and [St. Mark's Bookshop](http://www.stmarksbookshop.com/ "The website of another bookstore in New York City.").)

#### And what software?

**Web technologies:** I love [oXygen][], the XML editor, for most web development involving code (not just XML). When building websites that require a CMS, I stick to [WordPress][] or Drupal. My favorite FTP client is [Transmit][], from Panic. I use [Git][] from the command line for version control. For usability testing and other screencasting, I'm trying out [Adobe Captivate][captivate]. (I tried using [Morae][], but because I'm testing small/mid-size project sites, I have no use for most of its features.) [BrowserStack][] is great for cross-browser/platform website testing. 

**Information organization:** I open [Microsoft Office][office] as little as possible. Most of my word processing happens in [Evernote][], either online or in the app. I love it because they have an export-into-HTML function I use to back up everything. (Make sure the services you pour time and soul into have the option to export into an open format! The cloud can be great, but you still need to cover your bases.) I track project progress using [Trello][], and organize sources/citations using [Mendeley][]. 

**Text:** [Python][] comes in handy often, since I do some text processing and mining. I use Python 2.7 in [IDLE][] and have found the [Natural Language Toolkit][ntlk] (NLTK 2.0) to be helpful. I have also made good use of [Oracle SQL Developer][sql-developer] and [Data Miner][data-miner]. For plain text work, [TextWrangler][] is a necessity, and [Jumpcut][] is the best tiny app — it remembers up to 50 of your most recent clipboard items.

**Graphic:** Adobe CS5 [Photoshop][], [Illustrator][], and [InDesign][].

**Backup and transfer:** Apple's built-in [Time Machine][time-machine] is all right. But of course, one should not have solely local backups! I've been using [Backblaze][] for a few months and am satisfied. The service offers full restores, which I am happy to say I've never had to use. I have, however, used the restore function on individual files I needed to access from afar. I also use [Dropbox][] as a file transfer and sharing service. 

**Fun:** I manage five Twitter accounts using [Tweetdeck][]. [Rdio][] is my go-to for music. And I just discovered that [LIMBO][], the most beautiful game I've ever had the pleasure to play, is available in the Mac App Store.

**Contact:** On behalf of the library, my colleagues and I use [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/John-Jay-College-Library/291505825471 "The library Facebook account."), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/johnjaylibrary "The library's Twitter account."), and email to communicate with students. We also have a biannual newsletter and a handful of video tutorials. We are now considering experimenting with [Skype][], [Instagram][instagram-ios], [Tumblr][], [Flickr][], and/or [Pinboard][] to further facilitate communication, instruction, and reference services - and to show off the cool collections at the Lloyd Sealy Library.

#### What would be your dream setup?

John Jay has some incredibly interesting and frequently used special collections. The library has already digitized quite a few items, including [trial transcripts](http://www.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/crimeinny/trials/ "The library's trial transcripts site.") and [crime images](http://dig.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/cgi-bin/library.exe?site=localhost&a=p&p=about&c=newcrime&l=en&w=utf-8 "The library's crime images site.") from New York 1850-1950. My dream setup would certainly include the scanning equipment and student worker minions to get more of our collections online.

I once worked at the [Smithsonian Institution Archives](http://siarchives.si.edu/ "The Smithsonian Archives' website.") for a summer as a web preservation intern. For someone who truly believes in the importance of digital preservation, it was a dream to be surrounded not only by fancy modern computers and scanners, but also by legacy equipment from many years ago – old laserdisc players and ZIP drives, card readers and computers that predate me, all kinds of old machines necessary to extract information from the boxes of research and cultural material the Smithsonian regularly receives. So, a dream setup would be a lab with all of this great old (and working!) equipment, ready to preserve our digital cultural legacy! 

Lastly, I just moved to New York City, and now I understand why everyone drinks coffee all the time - it just takes so much energy to live here. So my dream setup would include a [fancy espresso machine](https://svpply.com/shop/categories/home?search=espresso%20machine "A search for espresso machiens on Svpply.").
