#### Who are you, and what do you do?

Today I like to think of myself as doing "heavy lifting" and as a technically competent creative. I try to aspire to be playful, artistic and innovative. I'm committed to open source for good work. My own site at [http://hook.org](http://hook.org/ "Anselm's website.") I hope reflects an integrity and commitment that side-steps banal concerns of say making dollars and the like. My small group of maker peers at [http://blog.makerlab.org](http://blog.makerlab.org/ "MakerLab's weblog.") also aspire to the same aesthetic. The fundamental quest and interest is new work, new ideas and innovation.

In my day job I am CTO at [Meedan](http://meedan.net/ "A digital town square."). We are a non-profit funded by Rockerfeller, MacArthur and IBM and our business is doing real time English-Arabic translation to bridge cultural barriers and to help burgeoning social networks straddle language boundaries.

Personally I grew up programming and spent most of my career developing video games such as [Dragon's Lair](http://www.gamespot.com/3do/action/dragonslair/index.html "Information on Dragon's Lair."). Making video games is a young man's sport. It is intense, long hours, highly multi-disciplinary, in environments where failing to ship on time would bankrupt the company. This has given me strong technical skills. In some senses I stand in a place that is the future and I look back at the ongoing web 2.0 phenomena. I see how the web is moving towards the place where I and other game developers already were years ago. Practices like "many participant", "agile development", "customer driven design" were internalized a long time ago in the (unfortunately hermetic) video game developer community.

#### What hardware do you use?

There are three loves I have:

1) The most important hardware to me are my servers. I have several machines at home in Canada, and two machines at Hurricane Electric in California and with Meedan, my employer, we have a rack up here in Portland. We're using all these machines for a variety of purposes; to aggregate content, to analyze content and to present a number of user facing applications. We also have some hardware in the cloud at [EC2][] for our FoodGenome project. I'm extremely pleased with all these machines and they haven't let me down yet.

2) Second to that is my [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro]. I have nothing but love for this machine.

3) Third is my [iPhone][] - again a spectacular device that has literally changed my life.

#### And what software?

This is a long one.

I have a soft spot for [OpenBSD][] in part due to the strong philosophical stance and resultant code quality and integrity that my friends there enforce. I was influenced heavily here by Theo Deraadt who runs the project and who lived in Calgary as well as me at the time. In particular tools like [PF][] and [OpenSSH][] make me very happy. Of course everybody knows about these but SSH deserves special recognition because it's the backbone of the Internet.

For my desktop I've switched to Apple [OS X][mac-os-x] (grudgingly at the prodding of [my girlfriend](http://paigesaez.org "Paige's website.")) but have had a completely superior experience and it has changed the way I work. Everything "just works" from having a good UNIX shell to having [MacPorts][] to having somewhat esoteric tools like [Merb][], [OpenCV][] and [MapServer][] install from source first try seamlessly.

In hands-on-work I reach for [Ruby][]. I find it a succinct and expressive grammar. What surprises me is that I didn't expect it to become my language of choice. Like many developers I've used just about everything - [Python][], [Lua][], [C++][c-plusplus], [PHP][], [Java][], [C#][c-sharp] - but now naturally find myself reaching for and preferring Ruby best.

In terms of development frameworks I feel [Merb][] is best because it consolidates the model in one place and allows different database handlers.

Of course there are a smattering of applications we all use every day. Most people have about 7 different apps that they care to deal with. For me these are [Twitter][] (which is largely replacing flickr, delicious and the like) and [Gmail][], and [Firefox][], [Colloquy][], [Skitch][], [Processing][] and [Xcode][]. I've tended to start using Xcode for editing source code in general although historically I've just used [vi][].

#### What would be your dream setup?

At one point I did want an interactive stand up gestural display data-wall similar to "[Minority Report](http://www.wikinomics.com/blog/uploads/minority-report-ui.jpg "An example of the interface used in 'Minority Report'.")".

But today I value my mobility more than power. What I want is an Augmented Reality Display that lets me both see the data in the world and annotate it and manipulate it. For example one can imagine
something like [the following link](http://www.virtualworldlets.net/Resources/Hosted/WhatIsAR/augmented-reality-hud.jpg "A mock-up of a HUD.").

Despite my passion for software I've been very interested in being outdoors and blending better my physical presence with the real world. If I could I'd prefer to just spend all my time outdoors; doing work such as annotating the real world with appropriate meta-data.

As far as actual development of new software - the tools are getting much better - I can't really complain; but there's definitely a gap between my childhood expectation of how I would express work and how I do so now. I imagined that by the time I grew up we'd be able to have Lego languages where anybody could plug things together and have a kind of intuitive understanding of the expression of work. I did think that everybody would know how to program and that programming would be easy - since programming IS easy it just isn't very readable and the grammars are still unusually pedantic. But I did feel services like [Yahoo Pipes][yahoo-pipes] are starting to move closer to where I imagine the ultimate interfaces would be.
