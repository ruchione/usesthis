#### Who are you, and what do you do?

[I'm](http://www.stroustrup.com/ "Bjarne's website.") a Danish computer scientist living in New York City. I work on ways to produce better large-scale dependable systems. My main contribution is [C++][c-plusplus] and effective ways of using it. I still work on the ISO C++ standard and use C++ in practical systems. I'm also a professor, occasionally giving design courses.

#### What hardware do you use?

A [Microsoft Surface][surface-pro-3] for traveling and a variety of Linux boxes for heavier lifting.

#### And what software?

Fairly "vanilla" software. I use the major C++ compilers and whatever tools are common on a platform. I'm very keen on portability, so I avoid dependencies on complicated stuff that work on only one platform.

#### What would be your dream setup?

Two pounds, good keyboard, good pen for scribbling and drawing, dockable, running all the major operating systems. Good Internet connection, but able to perform perfectly when disconnected from the web. Able to act as an interface to other systems. Simple and predictable to use. Stable, never needs rebooting.

Obviously, such a marvel does not exist today.
